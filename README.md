Welcome to the "DiabetesPrediction" GitHub Repository!  Explore our Django-powered project designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients. Leveraging the power of machine learning, specifically logistic regression, we've created a robust model that analyzes crucial patient parameters to provide insightful predictions.
